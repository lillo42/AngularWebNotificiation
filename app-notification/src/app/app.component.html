  <p>Welcome to the push messaging codelab. The button below needs to be
  fixed to support subscribing to push.</p>
  <p>
    <button (click)='updateSubscription()'>
      {{ btnMensagem }}
    </button>
  </p>
  <section class="subscription-details js-subscription-details" *ngIf="subscriptionJson !== ''">
    <p>Once you've subscribed your user, you'd send their subscription to your
    server to store in a database so that when you want to send a message
    you can lookup the subscription and send a message to it.</p>
    <p>To simplify things for this code lab copy the following details
    into the <a href="https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/">Push Companion
    Site</a> and it'll send a push message for you, using the application
    server keys on the site - so make sure they match.</p>
    <pre><code class="js-subscription-json">{{ subscriptionJson }}</code></pre>
